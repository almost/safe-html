safe-html
=========
 [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/safe-html.png?downloads&downloadRank)](https://nodei.co/npm/safe-html/)

Santitize HTML using a whitelist of allowed elements and attributes. Parses the HTML using [parse5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse5) which uses the [HTML5 parsing algorithm](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/parsing.html) (meaning it should parse documents the same way your browser does).


```javascript
var santitized = safeHtml("<div onclick=\"javascript:alert('Oh no!')>Hello <script>alert('Whoops!')</script>World</div>");
// santitized is now "<div>Hello World</div>";
```
